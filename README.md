# neuroascii

Given all the news around AI and new 'smarter' models coming out at the speed of light I had to do some experiments! Inspired by some of the @antirez videos around the topic (thanks so much for sharing so much free wisdom, we all owe you a lot!). 
I started to do some tests on: claude, deepseek, chatgpt and gemini. I asked them all a pretty complicated question:

I would like to build as excercise a neural network written in python that builds an ascii art logo of linkedin looking like this:

After numerous attempts, I finally got an answer that seems to be producing a correct result, the only one model that eventually responded correctly is o3-mini https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/. I am super impressed!

This is an ongoing experiment inspired by pure curiosity and interest in the topic, hence take it with the pinch of salt.
By no mean I am an expert of AI, by no mean I am advertising any platform, I am just curious as f... :D
